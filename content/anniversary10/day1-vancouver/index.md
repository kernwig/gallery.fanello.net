title: Day 1 - Vancouver Canada
description: |-
  <p>Our trip began with an early flight out of LAX to Vancouver Canada.</p>
  <p>
    The Canadian customs form is always interesting for cruises.
    "How long is your stay in Canada?" Oh, about two hours.
    Because it was pick up luggage, shuttle ride to the cruise terminal, and into
    the line for USA customs before boarding the ship:
    the Sapphire Princess. ðŸ¤©
