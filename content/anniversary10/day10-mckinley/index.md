title: Day 10 - McKinley Lodge
description: |-
  <p>
    The day was mostly a coach ride from Denali Wilderness Lodge to the McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge,
    hanging out there, and early to bed due to still being sick.

    While the previous lodge was near the park entrance, this one is a bit out in the middle of nowhere!
    It's a big property, requiring a shuttle bus to get around. It's also on a street aptly named
    "McKinley View Road", because this is a great place to actually <i>see</i> the Denali (formerly McKinley)
    mountain peak! They say only 30% of visitors actually get to see the mountain. Indeed, in the two days we
    were there it was visible for less than an hour in total, over a few times the peek peaked out.
