description: |-
  <p>
    Still at McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge, we took the shuttle ride to the town of 
    <a href="https://talkeetnachamber.org/">Talkeetna</a>.
    At about a 50 minute ride, it's the nearest town of substance with a population of a bit over 1,000.
    It's also where all the touristy things happen. 
    Also, for 20+ years it's mayorship has been held by two cats.
  </p>
  <p>
    We went on the <a href="https://mahaysriverboat.com/devils-canyon-adventure/">Devil's Canyon Adventure</a>!
    It's a five hour ride 130 miles up river on a jetboat, a nature walk with reproductions of how the earliest native
    and non-native settlers lived, and a wild ride in the intense rapids if Devil's Canyon.
