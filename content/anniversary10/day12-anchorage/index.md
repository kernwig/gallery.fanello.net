title: Day 12 - Anchorage
description: |-
  <p>
    On our last day, we took a shuttle from McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge to Anchorage to stay
    our final night at Captain Cook Hotel.
    The shuttle made an unscheduled stop at the Iditarod Trail Race headquarters, which we watched
    the dogs run tourists in a loop and visited the gift shop.

  <p>
    We had an excursion booked, but skipped it because we lacked the energy.
    So just had a nice lunch at the hotel, and slept.

    The next day, a bus took us to the airport and we flew home.
