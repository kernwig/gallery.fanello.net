title: Day 5 - Skagway
description: |-
  <p>Skagway is a compact city in southeast Alaska, set along the popular cruise route the Inside Passage. It's home to gold-rush-era buildings, now preserved as part of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. The White Pass & Yukon Route Railroad runs vintage locomotives past the famously steep Chilkoot trail and offers sweeping mountain views during its climb toward Canada.</p>

    Unfortunately, Diana was taken down by a sinus infection and spent the day sleeping.
    We had two excursions already booked, and so Adam ventured out on his own.
  </p>
  <p>
    First was the <a href="https://www.redonion1898.com/">Red Onion Saloon / brothel museum</a>, which Adam must
    stress was <i>Diana's</i> idea and he felt a bit awkward attending alone. ðŸ«¢<br>
    Second was a trolley tour of the town.
