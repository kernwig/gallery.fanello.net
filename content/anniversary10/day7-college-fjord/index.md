  <p>
    You may notice this album skips day 6. This is due to Adam joining Diana in illness and missing out
    on <a href="https://www.nps.gov/glba/index.htm">Glacier Bay National Park</a>. ðŸ˜• 
  </p>
  <p>
    Diana was feeling well enough to venture out some on this day though, and capture these photos of College Fjord
    and the evening show - a typical cruise ship song and dance number.

    College Fjord is a fjord located in the northern sector of Prince William Sound in the U.S. state of Alaska. 
    The fjord contains five tidewater glaciers, five large valley glaciers, and dozens of smaller glaciers, 
    most named after renowned East Coast colleges.
