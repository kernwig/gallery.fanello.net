title: Day 9 - Denali
description: |-
  <p>
    This was our one day actually <i>inside</i> Denali National Park, for a Tundra Wilderness Bus Tour.  
  </p>
  <p>
    This was a fantastic tour! Our driver was a very well versed naturalist with a bit of a poetic philosopher bend,
    and we saw a nice variety of animals. We didn't actually see Denali mountain while in the park. That comes later...
