    From December 12, 2024 until January 5, 2025, Adam and Diana embarked on their longest
    road trip ever together. They to explored the culture and sights along the western coastline
    of the United States. Much of the trip was along the famous Pacific Coast Highway, or "PCH".

    Our travel rig was a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee pulling along a 2017 Escape 21C travel trailer,
    dubbed the S.S. Iceberg. (Historically S.S. stands for Steam Ship - but in this case it is a
    Street Ship!)

    We got off to a late start; as Adam posted on Facebook a week before:
  
    <blockquote>
      How do you find all sorts of things to replace and repair in your car?
      Plan a road trip!
      Suddenly everything is broken. ðŸ’¸
    </blockquote>

    The entire trip was documented, day by day, on Facebook. Content has been copied here.

    We hope you enjoy following along with our adventure!
