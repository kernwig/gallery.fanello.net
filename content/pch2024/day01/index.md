  The PCH road trip begins!
  <p/>
  Our tow vehicle's engine repairs finally finished yesterday afternoon. 
  We picked it up, loaded it up, and hit the road shortly after 6pm. 
  Made it through L.A. and just shy of the grapevine where we pulled off in Angeles National Forest. 
  Tried Oak Flat Campground in the forest, but found it too small for trailer camping. 
  So just found a nice wide, flat, and sheltered from the I-5 shoulder on Old Golden State Hwy. 
  It was great. No traffic on this old road during the night - minimal in the morning. Slept well.
  <p/>
  Off to Paso Robles!

  (No photos for just driving though Las Angeles, so here is a reference photo from 2021 showing how we roll.)
