title: Day 3 - Monterey & Carmel
description: |-
  Today we awoke to find out a rain storm was about to hit, so we quickly packed up and got on the road just as the storm began. Saw a few nice rainbows. ðŸŒˆ 
  <p/>
  I was concerned about getting into the first-come campground in the middle of Monterey, so wanted to be there by noon. When around right about noon, and saw one class-c RV and lots of empty space! No problem. Picked a spot.
  <p/>
  After breakfast at lunch time (remember, we left in a hurry), we went for the famous 17-mile drive through the coast of Pebble Beach, the famous golf course and community of mansions. Some of the houses were interesting, but the beaches...! Absolutely worth the $12 entry fee.
  <p/>
  Finished up at Carmel by the Sea. Tried to visit the Mount Carmel Mission, but it was closed due to power outage. Most of the Monterey peninsula was on limited power due to wind damage from the morningâ€™s storm. Thank you PG&E. We gave a couple a ride back to their hotel, who couldnâ€™t call for an Uber due to the power outage, and spent some time socializing. Walked Carmel by the Sea, ate dinner at a sports bar with only half their power circuits working, and came back to camp.
  <p/>
  Quite an interesting day! Enjoy the photos.
