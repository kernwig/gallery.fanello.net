title: Day 4 - Monterey Bay Aquarium
description: |-
  Today we visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Diana had heard it was better than the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, but we found it to be about the same. A bit different, but not better or worse. Still, we enjoyed it. Walked along historic Cannery Row afterwords.
