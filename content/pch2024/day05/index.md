title: Day 5 - Santa Cruz
description: |-
  Today was a rainy day 🌧. Diana was wanted to visit the museum at the mission in Monterey, but it was again closed. So we packed up and headed north to Santa Cruz! It was mostly just a scenic driving day, trying to find a place to stay for the night, and make our way a bit closer to Half Moon Bay were we have reservations for the next two nights. (Spoiler!)
  <p/>
  We stopped at the Natural Arches State Beach just about an hour before sunset but after the rain finally stopped. Found one rock with a hole through it, making <b>an</b> arch. 🫤 Diana found a short path of what we think are the biggest eucalyptus trees 🌲
  we’ve ever seen and the Monarch Butterfly 🦋 trail. We only made it a short way before it was closed off. No butterflies out in the rain.
  <p/>
  As we drove around, we spotted where some other RVs and vans were hanging out on the side of public streets, picked a small one next the UCSC coastal campus, and set up for the night.
