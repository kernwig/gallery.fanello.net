title: Day 6 - Travel to Half Moon Bay
description: |-
  Street parking overnight was uneventful. As we departed though, the Jeepâ€™s check engine light came on. ðŸ˜§ Not again! Our departure was delayed for a day and a half as repairs were made. Now something new.
  <p/>
  As I write this, Iâ€™m in the camper and in the parking lot for Big-O waiting for a part and all the cars carefully maneuvering around us to get in and out of bays.
  <p/>
  Around 2pm, we were clear to go! Arrived at our campground in Half Moon Bay at about 4pm, after a drive along Hwy 1 in the infamous central coast fog. Weâ€™re right next to the beach! This will be our home for three nights. Next two days: day tripping into San Francisco!
