title: Day 8 - More San Francisco
description: |-
  Today was Dianaâ€™s choice, so we visited the Disney Family museum and Alcatraz. 
  At the Disney museum, we explored the life and career of Walt Disney and his parents, grand parents, brother, wife, children, etcâ€¦ but also of his entire career. 
  He failed and started over a couple times before becoming the huge success we know today.
  <p/>
  The Rock (Alcatraz island, not Dwayne Johnson) was certainly worth the visit. Itâ€™s a fairly short tour reallyâ€¦ and cold at night! 
  However, worth the time spent to visit this landmark and learn its history.
