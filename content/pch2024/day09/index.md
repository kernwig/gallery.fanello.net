title: Day 9 - Bay Area Travel
description: |-
  Nothing exciting today. Packed up from the beach campground we’ve been staying three nights out, and hit the local laundromat 🫧! After a bit over a week, it was needed. 😉
  <p/>
  Diana had made contact with someone who does monthly square dance parties, drop in lesson, social, and dance in Berkley just across the bay. So we made plans to stay the night at a Harvest Host farm 👨‍🌾🫏 north of there just shy of Napa and headed there first. I missed a turn and we took the bridge out of San Francisco over to Berkeley (via Treasure Island in the bay) instead of the Golden Gate directly up toward Napa. So… lots of traffic and a hefty bridge toll that I was trying to avoid. 😔
  Got to our site for the night and unhitched. This farm was hard to find, winding through two miles of other fields and grapes. Lovely property! Saw a few 🐇🐇🐇 🫏.
  <p/>
  Diana looked up the details for this dance way back in Berkeley (45 - 60 minutes back, but without the camper) and discovered it was $20/person. That was the last straw… not going. We went to IHOP instead. 🤣 🥞
  <p/>
  Also went to Target, and got some rain boots for me and waterproofing spray. There’s an “atmospheric river” coming (new term for a series of rain storms) that has the forecast in Northern California calling for rain 🌧️, every day of the ten-day forecast. 😭
