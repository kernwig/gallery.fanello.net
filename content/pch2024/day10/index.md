title: Day 10 - Decision & Travel
description: |-
  We woke to our cattle neighbors this morning. 🐮 Moo to you too! 😊
  <p/>
  Today we had to make a decision. The forecast to continue our drive north called for ten days of rain 🌧️. On the eleventh day, it would (maybe) start to dry up. Giving us a few days to enjoy the redwoods 🌲 that we wanted to visit before having to go all out for the long haul back home. 🫤
  <p/>
  We thought about giving up on PCH and going inland to the mountains🏔️, but that had lows below freezing. We were near Sacramento, making another city to visit, but then what? Escape the cold in Death Valley🏜️? Have to get through those freezing 🥶 mountains!
  <p/>
  Then it hit me 🤦‍♂️. Keep with PCH, just go SOUTH! We started in Monterey because of a road closure in Big Sur and because we could easily hit Southern California on shorter one-week trips. We might as well just go now! We knew traveling north in December was a gamble 🎰. We lost. That’s okay. We adapt.
  <p/>
  So now we’re at a Harvest Host olive farm just north of Paso Robles off Hwy 101. Back around where we were a week ago. We’re camped high up a hill and at least a mile from any other human being. Came in after dark (shortest day of the year!), so pictures tomorrow as we head back to the coast 🌊.
