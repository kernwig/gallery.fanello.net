title: Day 11 - Paso Robles(ish)
description: |-
  First, more about where we awoke this morning. It’s a Harvest Host right off Hwy 101. There's the olive processing, an olive oil 🫒 tasting bar, and shop, plus Tesla Super Charger station ⚡️! One can camp right there, but we like to be away from the activity and this place is massive! There is space for entire RV rallies to be hosted here. After being led up the hill for about two miles, our host pointed out our spot with a fire ring and about two acres of flat grassy space. Amazing!
  <p/>
  Last night we made a reservation for Morro Bay State Park campground; this will be our basecamp through Christmas 🎄. No hookups unfortunately, but a park and beach access right in the bay of Morro Bay.

  While passing through Paso Robles again, we went looking for Diana’s uncle’s old property. We found a whole lot of vineyards and <i>maybe</i> that old property, but the area has a lot more homes and vines now so it was hard to recognize. But we did find sheep! 🐑🐑🐑🐑
  <p/>
  We stopped at Walmart to pick up a few supplies. The last few days, Taco Bells have been looking appealing so we went out for Mexican dinner - but an authentic family-run place. It was so authentic, it even included a little boy riding his tiny bicycle 🚲 with training wheels between the tables and sticking his tongue out at us. 😆 Great food. I got my taco fix and Diana had stuffed her Mexican belly too. 🌮
