title: Day 13 - Big Sur
description: |-
  Merry Christmas Eve! 🎄 It was a rainy ☔️ morning here in central California, so we spent it taking some downtime to catch our breaths. 
  I also got a bit of work done, as I’m still working part-time during this trip.
  <p/>
  When the skies cleared 🌤️, we visited the little natural history museum here at the Morro Bay state park and then headed back
  up Highway 1 as far as it would take us! You may not know, but the road had a slide a couple years ago (again) in Big Sur 
  making it impassable. CalTrans is on the job 🚧, but it’s a big job to do right and taking some years. 
  But that didn’t stop us from driving some 50 miles further up the road than we have been and enjoying this epic drive on
  our nation’s most beautiful coast! 🤩
