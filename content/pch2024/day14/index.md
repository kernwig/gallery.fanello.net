description: |-
  Merry Christmas! 🎄🎅🤶
  <p/>
  Today we traveled a bit south to Montaña de Oro State Park ⛰️ and confirmed that we *have* been there before, a few years ago. 
  The tide 🌊 was even higher this time, likely due to the storm system up north and so we stayed out of the tidal pool. 
  (Part of the Santa Cruz wharf collapsed yesterday. 🥺) Took a hike out on the short Bluff Trail, which gave us the fantastic 
  photos and short videos you will see below. Absolutely beautiful cove! 😍
  <p/>
  Finding lunch on Christmas day was a bit of a challenge, but found a little Mexican market that also made food. 
  The owner spoke a little English and I spoke a little Spanish, and we managed to order. 🇲🇽
  <p/>
  Afterwords we stopped by the Coastal Access Monarch Butterfly Preserve 🦋, a nice suburban forest next to Morro Bay. 
  Unfortunately, it’s a really bad year for the monarches and we didn’t see any. ☹️ 
  Then a stop of Morro Coast Audubon Society Sweet Sprint Nature Preserve. (They couldn’t find a shorter name?) 
  Saw some birds and deer in their little forest and more birds out in the bay.
  <p/>
  Then back to our camper for a nice Christmas dinner (thanks love 😘) and reservations to stay right here another two nights,
  because 🥁… the check engine light is on again! 🤦
