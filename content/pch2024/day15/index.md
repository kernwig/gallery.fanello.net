title: Day 15 - Chaos Day
description: |-
  As mentioned yesterday, the check engine light came on so we booked a couple more days in Morro Bay to give time to deal with that. 
  We took it to Autozone to read the code and found it was the same emissions sensor we fixed last time! 
  Diana will call our mechanic back home to find out if it’s something that can wait.
  <p/>
  I have slowly been watching our battery power diminish though. We just aren’t used to boondocking (no hookups) for this long, 
  and the solar panels in the winter just aren’t quite replenishing our usage. After speaking with the ranger at check-in, 
  she was very kind and let us park in hook-up site for an of hour to charge up the battery. 
  (The site is available for tonight, but not two nights so we couldn’t simply stay.)
  <p/>
  Here’s the other kicker. I wasn’t feeling quite right yesterday afternoon. 
  By evening, it became clear that I have a bacterial infection. 
  Of course I have Kaiser for the rest of the year and am in a county that they don’t have operations. 
  Managed to get a phone consult and antibiotics ordered at a local RiteAid.
  <p/>
  So.. camper needed power, car needed repair, I needed antibiotics, one of our two propane tanks needed filling (did that), 
  and laundry needed doing (done). This trip is catching up with us!
  <p/>
  (No photos taken, so here's a bonus one from yesterday.)
