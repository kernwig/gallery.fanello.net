title: Day 17 - Morro Rock
description: |-
  (I, Adam,) Spent yesterday being sick and Diana taking care of me. ðŸ¤’
  <p/>
  We had to move today, so down in Oceano (just south of Pismo Beach) to an RV park for a couple nights with full hookups. 
  RV parks are basically nice parking lots; this is our first one this trip. 
  We needed hookups though, as our camper battery completely drained this morning. A night hooked up will take care of that.
  <p/>
  On our way out, we finally stopped at Morro Rock. Thereâ€™s some pictures of that.
