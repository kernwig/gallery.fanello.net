title: Day 18 - Pismo Beach
description: |-
  I’m still low energy today from being sick, but doing a bit better. Our camper is feeling better too, 
  fully charging up its battery ⚡️ on the RV park hookups.
  <p/>
  We visited yet another monarch butterfly 🦋 preserve today right next to Pismo beach. Unlike Santa Cruz and Morro Bay, 
  we actually saw butterflies! Not many though - there was an estimated 500+ butterflies here instead of the typical tens of thousands. 
  Bad year for the little buggers. 🥺
  <p/>
  Did I mention Pismo Beach? 🏖️ It’s famous, and yet actually a small town of under 8,000 people. 
  However they handle a huge tourist population really well even in the winter. The neighboring cities have to count too. 
  We’re staying in an RV park with “Pismo” in the name, but is actually in Oceano (city). 
  We drive four miles through Grover Beach to get to the tiny city that is actually Pismo Beach.
  <p/>
  Anyway, enough geography. From the butterfly preserve we walked between Pismo Beach State Park’s north campground 
  (way more spacious than our RV park) and dunes to the actual beach. Just an expanse of perfect sand. 
  Nobody laying out with umbrellas here, mostly just people walking about taking in the beauty.
  <p/>
  After that walk and not having eaten much from being sick, I wanted a hamburger. So I sought out the best rated 
  burger joint in the immediate area and found Burgers & More. Beach town burger joint, for sure. 
  Quick serve place at a upscale price, but it was worth it! 🤩
  <p/>
  Then Diana went to the pier because she hear rumor of otters there. I was tuckered out and so waited in the car.
  Later met up with her at the base of the pier. The tide was out - no otters. 🦦
  <p/>
  Back at the camper, we played some games and watched the Christmas classic Die Hard on the little TV/DVD player we 
  haven’t pulled out from under the bed in years. And here we are. We actually have the rest of our trip roughly scheduled now. 
  Just one more city and then back home next weekend.
