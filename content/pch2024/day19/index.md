title: Day 19 - Dinosaur Caves Park
description: |-
  Today was another maintenance morning (clean out camper tanks, last laundry while we had easy access at the RV park. 
  I got a bit of time in at work (my job) as well.
  <p/>
  Then it was off to Dinosaur Park! It’s a community park right on the ocean’s edge, so great views! (All photos below are from here.)
  Also plentiful parking, so we just spent the afternoon here with the camper hitched. Relaxing and working (day job again).
  <p/>
  For the evening, we crashed Cuesta Square’s Eve of New Year’s Eve dinner and square dance! We’ve been looking in each city, 
  but this was our first match up (with a bit of adjustment to our schedule) to actually attend a dance. 🎉💃🕺🏻🔲  
  Darren Gallina is the caller here, and we danced with him, his partner Thom, and some members of this club weekly through 
  Zoom during the pandemic 😷. It was great to dance in person for a change. 😆 (We forgot to take a photo with them. 😞)
  <p/>
  Tonight we’re stealth camping the night at an undisclosed location before heading to the Santa Barbara area tomorrow. See you there!
