title: Day 20 - La Purisima Mission
description: |-
  Good day everybody! Today we headed on over to Cachuma Lake County Park in Santa Barbara to enjoy a spacious camp
  site within limited view of the lake. 😍
  <p/>
  On the way, we stopped at La Purisima Mission State Historic Park. This was California’s eleventh Spanish mission,
  but what is most special about it is that between 1934 and 1941 the Civilian Conservation Corps rebuilt it. 
  It had literally turned back to mud, but using traditional methods they brought the mission back. 
  Not just the church like we see in a lot of the other missions, but it really looks like a village, complete with some livestock! 
  The buildings tell a story, as does the visitor center. If you have an interest in the California missions, 
  this is the one to come visit! I’ve included a few pictures, but if you want more talk to Diana; she walked 🚶 the whole thing, 
  read every sign 🪧, and took over 100 photos. 📷
  <p/>
  The drive also took us through a portion of Highway 1 that goes through Vandenberg Space Force Base. 
  All we saw was some beautiful oak covered hills, and the base’s main entrance. I did spot something in the distance… 🧐
