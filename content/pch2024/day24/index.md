description: |-
  Today concludes our travels! We’re back home, with gobs of bags of things to unpack, clean, and put away.
  <p/>
  We broke camp in the Santa Monica mountains this morning and drove down PCH through Malibu into Santa Monica. 
  Upon sighting the ferris wheel 🎡 and roller coasters 🎢 of the pier, we hoped onto the I-10 East and headed home. 
  Reached the Silverado Post Office just before the noon closing time to pick up our accumulated mail 📫. We’re home!
  <p/>
  Chickens survived 🐓, thanks to our neighbors Anthony & Susan. Garden looks healthy. 🪴
  Nothing really changed at home; it sat and waited for us to return for 24 days.
  <p/>
  It’s back to normal life this week. I hope you all enjoyed my daily posts here. (Trip was originally documented on Facebook.) 
  Thank you to our friend Dan Clairmont, who inspired me to do this through his example.
